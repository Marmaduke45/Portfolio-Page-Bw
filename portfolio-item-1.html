            <p>I made this site because I was tired of having to write down all the stretching routines I had; not to mention having to count for each stretch
                made it hard to keep a consitent routine. This web app fixed those problems for me and my friends who all use it.
                The app allows you to keep track of your routine and includes a timer so you can focus on breathing and form rather than how many seconds it's been.

            <p>While making this project I learned a ton about React and advanced JavaScript. I used react router for the first time in a project and 
                was forced to learn about Routing, prop-drilling, localStorage with React, the component lifecycle,
                and the interesting interactions between timers and react with the useEffect hook.</p>
            <p>The first big challenge I encountered was making the timer work as React can be a bit weird with timers. This took a lot of persistence, and searching
                through old stackOverflow answers to figure out. This helped me learn one of the concepts I had previously struggled with,
                useEffect and the component lifecycle. This was tricky to understand as most of the documentation is for class based components while I was working
                with function components.
                Along with that, getting my single page app to fit on a mobile screen while still looking nice on a computer or laptop created some challenges. Thanks
                to flexbox, I was able to get a design I liked.</p>
